title: Working towards a common understanding of grant data
---

## Hoping for…and contributing to a unified grant effort.

There are about 20 federal agencies that manage grants that range from health to disasters, to education to financial and so on. 

Within one agency there could multiple grant systems, each with similar functions such as award and reporting. All have a grantor, grantee, award process, adjudication, etc. There are all kinds of variations of what things are called. 

What we are hoping to do (if nothing else) is to help identify what is common across the systems. This is where NIEM comes.

A team within the NIEM community is working to modernize grants management within a federal agency. The data dictionary and conceptual model on this page represents a portion of their work. 

To date they have looked at over 64,000 data fields across 9 sytems, and narrowed that down to 3,200 that have a potential play in a grant activity. From there, they narrowed it down some more to about 114 fields that are the most common. Of the 114 most common, they narrowed it down some more to what could be considered the common core for grant data.

Sharing the information below to help build consensus of the data, from there we can look at the remaining.

### What is NIEM?
NIEM is a community-driven, standards-based approach to exchanging information. It’s about 11,000 terms, definitions, relationships, and formats independent of how data is stored in individual systems. It includes two sets of closely related vocabularies, core and individual domains. At the present time, there are 14 specific domains that are self-organized and self-governed. Subject matter experts within each domain develop and manage their content to meet the needs of their community. Collectively, these domains come together to manage core—content that is commonly agreed to and understood by all who use NIEM. 

For over 12 years, NIEM has facilitated information exchanges across a variety of mission spaces and subject areas. What began as a solution for the law enforcement and homeland security communities has since evolved into a wide range of subject matters and areas. What works for the mission side of the house, is very much applicable to administrative functions such as grants.

Multi-agency data sharing initiatives are becoming increasingly common, yet establishing a framework for coordination, decision making, and standardization remains a time consuming and complex undertaking.  NIEM provides such a framework that is ready-made for reuse, but few are aware of this resource, or misunderstand the purpose.  Rather than specifying a particular standard, NIEM prescribes a community-driven collaboration approach to sharing information, which in turn drives the eventual solution.  In other words, NIEM is designed to be flexible to the unique and ever-evolving data sharing requirements of government, and is looking for opportunities to advance its utilization as part of a larger data-centric movement.
