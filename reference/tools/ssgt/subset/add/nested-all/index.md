You can easily add all sub-properties of a type.

- Click the **`+`** icon next to a component to expand the list of sub-properties.
- From the sub-property list, click the **`Add`** button next to **`Add All`** label.  This will appear above the list of sub-properties.
- The property will be added to the appropriate **`Elements`** or **`Attributes`** section of the subset list on the left.
- The type, in not already in the subset, will be added to the **`Types`** section of the subset list on the left.

{:.note}
> This action affects only the designated type.  Any new type added to the subset through this action will be added empty.  Users will need to add individual or all sub-properties to as needed.
