### Load Wantlist

The SSGT does not provide user accounts.  Instead, the SSGT provides a wantlist file as part of a generated subset package that saves your list of selections.

In order to resume work on a subset, this wantlist must be uploaded into the SSGT.  Click on **`Choose File`** to select your most recent "wantlist.xml" file, either generated individually or as part of a subset package (zip file).

If you currently have components in your subset, you can choose to either merge or remove them when uploading a wantlist.
