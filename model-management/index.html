title: Model Management
---

<p>The NIEM model was designed to accommodate updates on a regular basis in order to adapt and evolve with user needs. <a href="https://www.niem.gov/technical/Pages/The-Model.aspx">Learn more about the model here</a>.</p>
<p>To incorporate change on a predictable and sustainable schedule, NIEM has implemented a release cycle for model updates. For each new release, the <a href="https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/nbac/Pages/default.aspx">NIEM Business Architecture Committee</a>, <a href="https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/ntac/Pages/default.aspx">NIEM Technical Architecture Committee</a>, and <a href="https://www.niem.gov/communities/Pages/communities.aspx">NIEM community</a> work together to update the model. </p>
<p>Individual NIEM domains manage domain updatesâ€”these can happen at any time. The updates are then incorporated into the next NIEM release (major or minor) for reconciliation and official publication. <a href="https://www.niem.gov/technical/Pages/Release-Cycle.aspx">Learn more about the NIEM release cycle here</a>.</p>
<p>New communities can add to the model through the NIEM domain onboarding process.  <a href="https://www.niem.gov/aboutniem/Pages/Domain-Onboarding.aspx">Learn more here</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re currently piloting the use of Github for domain model management. Thank you to the Emergency Management community for agreeing to give this a try&mdash;you&rsquo;re trailblazing the way for others! To the NIEM community, please provide your feedback on what works well, what could be improved...help us make this great!</p>
