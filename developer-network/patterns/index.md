title: Patterns
---
The patterns area will contain XML templates of the various NIEM XML components. These will be available for NIEM developers to cut and paste directly into their integrated development environment to save development time. Examples from the "Hello World" series will be provided so developers can see an actual worked example of the pattern as well.
