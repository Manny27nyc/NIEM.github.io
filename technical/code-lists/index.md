title: NIEM and Code Lists
---

NIEM provides a suite of techniques for working with code lists. The NTAC is
developing 3 principle documents supporting code lists in NIEM:

1. NIEM Genericode Code Lists Specification. [The latest draft is available in
GitHub](https://github.com/webb/niem-code-lists-spec-artifacts). Pre-release
versions and the final version of the specification will be posted to
[reference.niem.gov](http://reference.niem.gov/) as they are vetted by the
NTAC. This is a technical specification, which is targeted toward tool
developers, rather than users and implementors of exchanges.

1. [NIEM Code Lists User Guide](user-guide). This document provides
descriptions of the artifacts and techniques for working with NIEM code lists. It
is targeted towards exchange and system developers that use code lists in
specifying messages.

1. [NIEM Code Lists Primer](primer). This document provides a walk-through
exercising the code lists specification.

1. [NIEM Code Lists FAQ](faq). Frequently asked questions about NIEM code lists.

In addition to these core documents, there are additional resources that may be
useful to those developing and using code lists:

1. [The Genericode specification from
OASIS](http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cs-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html).
This is the specfication for Genericode documents.

1. [wrtools-csv-xml on GitHub](https://github.com/webb/wrtools-csv-xml): A
tool that creates Genericode documents from a CSV spreadsheet that contains code
values.

1. [niem-code-lists-spec-artifacts on
GitHub](https://github.com/webb/niem-code-lists-spec-artifacts): A Git
repository containing the releases and prereleases of the NIEM Code Lists
specification and related artifacts.

1. [niem-code-list-examples on
GitHub](https://github.com/webb/niem-code-list-examples): A Git repository for
code lists samples that were referenced in creating the NIEM code lists
specification.
