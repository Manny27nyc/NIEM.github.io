title: NIEM and Code Lists
---

NIEM provides several techniques for working with code lists. At this time,
there are a few documents available:

1. The [NIEM Code Lists Specification](niem-code-lists-specification) defines
   methods for using separate code list documents with NIEM information
   exchanges. It describes how to use CSV spreadsheet files or Genericode XML
   documents as representations of code lists. It describes how to connect
   messages to code lists at run time or at schema definition time. It also
   defines some common code list columns, which have meanings that are needed
   across the NIEM community. The NIEM Code Lists specification is provided a
   few different ways, including as a web page, ZIP file, or as a GitHub
   repository.

1. The [NIEM Code Lists FAQ](faq) answers some frequently asked questions about
   NIEM code lists.

1. Our page on [Genericode, a code list representation format](genericode)
   provides links to the Genericode specification and tools.

Documents under development:

1. A NIEM Code Lists User Guide, which will provide descriptions of the
   artifacts and techniques for working with NIEM code lists. It will be
   targeted towards exchange and system developers that use code lists in
   specifying messages.

1. A NIEM Code Lists Primer, which will provide a walk-through exercising the
   code lists specification.
