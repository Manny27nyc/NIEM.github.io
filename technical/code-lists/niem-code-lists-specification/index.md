The NIEM Code Lists Specification is a technical specification currently under
development by the NIEM Technical Architecture Committee (NTAC). It provides XML
syntax and rules that support the use of code lists in NIEM XML Schemas and
information exchange packages (IEPs).

The current version of the specification is {{page.current_code_lists_version}}.

Pre-release versions and the final version of the specification will be posted
to
[reference.niem.gov](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/code-lists/)
as they are vetted by the NTAC. This is a technical specification, which is
targeted toward tool developers, rather than users and implementors of
exchanges.
