title: NIEM and JSON
---

JSON is defined by [RFC 4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt):

> JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based,
language-independent data interchange format.  JSON defines a small set of
formatting rules for the portable representation of structured data.

The NIEM Technical Architecture Committee (NTAC) is in the process of developing
guidelines and specifications supporting the use of JSON with NIEM.

The first product of this process is
[*Using JSON with NIEM* (PDF)](using_json_with_niem.pdf). It identifies
motivating factors and the NTAC's initial plan for supporting JSON with NIEM.
