<h2>FAQ as of 3 March 2015</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>What are the objectives, audience, scope, and intent of this FAQ?</b>

    <p>The objectives of this FAQ are to assist the NTAC to (1) rapidly develop
      guidelines for IEPD implementers regarding the management of changes and
      versioning in IEPDs; (2) improve this guidance iteratively by soliciting
      NIEM community feedback and additional questions; and (3) ultimately
      produce a NIEM guidance and best practice document for IEPD versioning and
      change control.  The audience is intended to be NIEM IEPD implementers who
      share or transmit NIEM IEPs based on one or more IEPDs.  The scope covers
      all aspects of IEPD change control and versioning based on NIEM releases,
      including how NIEM releases relate to IEPDs and their implementations,
      compatibility, and what users and implementers should expect.  The intent
      is to help the NIEM community to understand how to implement NIEM
      effectively in the context of annual releases, as well as its limitations
      and trade-offs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Who is responsible for managing versions of a NIEM IEPD?</b>
    <p>An IEPD is designed and created independently from NIEM releases (the reference models).  The IEPD author, developer, or sponsor is responsible for managing IEPD versions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Does NIEM support backward compatibility?</b>

    <p>NIEM does not (and cannot) guarantee that an IEPD built from any given
      major or minor release version will be backward (or forward) compatible
      with another release.  In fact, once built, an IEPD and an IEPD
      implementation will not be impacted by new NIEM releases.  Any given IEPD
      is based on a set of XML data components defined in one or more published
      NIEM releases.  A correct implementation of that IEPD (a set of XML Schema
      documents) will send/receive IEPs (XML instances) defined by and that must
      be schema-valid to that IEPD.  Once designed and implemented, the IEPD is
      a fixed template for all IEPs that will be exchanged.  New NIEM releases
      have absolutely no impact on that IEPD or the IEPs that conform to it
      (until the implementer decides to update the IEPD to use a different
      release).  If errors occur in the exchange of IEPs, then either something
      is wrong with your IEPs (e.g., they are not schema-valid to the IEPD
      schema documents) or you've changed your IEPD (so again, your IEPs are now
      invalid).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>What is "backward compatibility", and how is it defined in NIEM?</b>
    <p>It is NOT!  Officially, backward compatibility is neither defined nor
      guaranteed in NIEM.  (More required here; need to discuss the elusive
      definition of "backward compatibility").</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>I've heard that "a NIEM minor release is backward compatible."  Is this
    true or not?</b>

    <p>There is a bit of truth to this statement.  A NIEM major series of
      releases is numbered as follows: 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, etc.  One and only one
      NIEM Core schema document (version 3.0) and <code>targetNamespace</code>
      is common to all of these releases.  The next NIEM major release (version
      4.0) will change the NIEM Core schema document.  So, release 4.0 will not
      use the 3.0 Core schema document.  Thus, one might say that the NIEM 3.0
      series (i.e., versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, etc.) is compatible in terms of Core
      because all versions in the series use the same NIEM Core schema document.
      However, domain schema documents may change within each minor release
      (3.1, 3.2, etc.). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>What does the following statement mean? ... "An IEPD is the point of NIEM
      interoperability."</b>
    <p>Once published, a NIEM release is always available as-is under a unique
      namespace.  Use of domain updates (DU) and core supplements (CS) published
      later for that release is optional.  So, once designed and built from a
      NIEM release, an IEPD implementation establishes interoperability among
      senders/receivers of XML instance documents (IEPs) that validate to the
      IEPD's schema document set.  This means that changes to NIEM (including
      new releases, as well as DUs or CSs to the release in use) have no impact
      on the IEPD implementation.  It will continue to work as long as IEPs (XML
      instance documents) are schema-valid to the original IEPD schema document
      set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Must an IEPD be updated (changed) when a new NIEM release is published?</b>
    <p>No, an IEPD is not required to change as a result of NIEM evolution.  If
      the data exchange requirements for which the IEPD was developed are still
      valid, then there is no reason to update the IEPD (even if new content in
      a recent NIEM release or domain update is available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>When must an IEPD be updated to a new NIEM release version?</b>

    <p>All previously published NIEM releases are always available on the
      <a href="http://release.niem.gov/">NIEM release site</a>.  Therefore, if
      an IEPD continues to satisfy its information sharing requirements as
      designed or implemented, then it is not necessary to update it for a newer
      NIEM release.  When an IEPD author, sponsor, implementer, or the
      exchanging parties determine that: (1) data exchange requirements have
      evolved significantly enough; or (2) newer NIEM content is available and
      need to use it within data exchanges exists; then, it may also be
      necessary to consider an update the IEPD and potentially to corresponding
      implementations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>How can two versions of an IEPD be processed?</b>

    <p>A software implementation can process one or more versions of an IEPD.
      The software should have a set of data structures for the data set defined
      by each IEPD (for example, a set of Java objects for each IEPD).  The
      software will associate an incoming IEP (XML instance) with one of two
      namespaces to determine which set of data structures to use for the
      incoming IEP.  To do this, it parses the IEP document element to identify
      the unique namespace of the schema that defines that element.  This
      namespace identifies which set of data structures to load with the
      incoming IEP data and subsequently process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>How should I make changes to or update my namespaces?</b>

    <p>An important NIEM practice is that once an XML Schema document with
    a <code>targetNamespace</code> has been established (and especially after it
    has been published and in use!), it MUST NOT be changed.  Every NIEM XML
    schema document MUST be assigned a <code>targetNamespace</code>.  Except
    subset schema documents, a change to any other NIEM schema document forces a
    change to its <code>targetNamespace</code>.  This ensures each NIEM schema
    document has a unique <code>targetNamespace</code> that distinguishes it
    from all others.  Note that a subset schema document is a constrained
    profile of a NIEM release (reference) schema document, so unlike other
    schemas it must have the same <code>targetNamespace</code> as the reference
    schema it subsets.  Note also that some standards development organizations
    (SDO) do not follow this namespace policy, and instead, change content
    directly within a published <code>targetNamespace</code>.  Others use a
    similar technique but add a version identifier that is not a part of the
    namespace.  In such cases, it can be difficult to know if the content of a
    namespace has changed (and which version you have).  The NIEM namespace
    policy ensures absolute transparency of change.  If two NIEM schema
    documents bear different target namespaces, then their content is different.
    Furthermore, subset schemas must be explicitly identified within MPDs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>What release versions of NIEM are available?</b>

    <p>NIEM release versions currently available are: 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0.
    These are all available for download
    at <a href="http://release.niem.gov/">http://release.niem.gov/</a>.  There
    are also a few domain updates and core supplements that can be used in IEPDs
    available in the NIEM Publication Area at
    <a href="http://publication.niem.gov/niem/">http://publication.niem.gov/niem/</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>How can I determine what version of a NIEM release an IEPD uses?</b>

    <p>There are several ways to determine the NIEM release used by an IEPD.
    (1) IEPD documentation should indicate the NIEM release version (or
    versions) in use.  (2) The <code>targetNamespace</code> attribute within
    each NIEM schema document will identify its version.
    The <code>targetNamespace</code> in <code>niem-core.xsd</code> and in NIEM
    domain schema documents identify the major (first integer) and minor (second
    integer) series of the NIEM version respectively.  (3) The namespaces
    referenced and imported by subset schema documents will also indicate the
    release version in use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Must an IEPD be based on a single NIEM numbered release, or can it employ
      XML data components from multiple releases?</b>

    <p>The NIEM
      <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0/"
         >Model Package Description Specification v3.0</a> allows an IEPD to
         employ XML data components from multiple NIEM releases.  This means
         that schema subsets from multiple releases can be used together in a
         single IEPD.  That said, mixing releases in an IEPD can introduce
         multiple versions of the same XML elements and types (sometimes with
         slight different structures) resulting in semantic duplication,
         overlap, and potential ambiguity.  On the other hand, each NIEM release
         has been harmonized to remove as much duplication as possible.
         Therefore, we prefer and strongly recommend that an IEPD be designed to
         use a single NIEM release version. This technique is easier to
         control, less complex, and less error-prone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Can I use NIEM core supplements (CS) and/or domain updates (DU) in my IEPD?</b>

    <p>A NIEM domain update (DU) is a
    <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0/"
       >model package description (MPD)</a> containing one or more schema
       documents that represent changes to one or more domains.  A NIEM core
       supplement (CS) is a special release MPD containing one or more schema
       documents that represent additions (only) to a NIEM core.  An IEPD may
       optionally incorporate DUs and/or CSs associated with a release.  Be
       aware that a DU or CS can introduce semantic overlap.  An IEPD developer
       should exercise this option carefully.  To the extent possible, avoid
       using components from a release and its associated CSs and DUs that
       together introduce duplicate versions of the same data components.  Use
       the subset technique where possible to reduce duplication.</p>
