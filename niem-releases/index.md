## NIEM 4.0

NIEM version 4.0 is **under development**. We encourage members of the community to
review this pre-release and submit comments.

The current draft of NIEM 4.0 is *NIEM 4.0 release candidate 3*. In the absence
of critical comments, this will be published as NIEM 4.0.

There are several ways to access the release:

- You may download
  [the complete NIEM 4.0 release candidate 3 schema package as a zip file](https://release.niem.gov/niem/4.0/niem-4.0rc3.rel.zip)
  from [release.niem.gov](https://release.niem.gov/niem/4.0/).

- You may browse the contents of NIEM 4.0 using [Movement](https://beta.movement.niem.gov).
  Movement has been updated to 4.0rc2. Model content was locked down in rc2 (release candidate 2), so you are essentially searching the production 4.0 release.
  
- You may browse the contents of NIEM 4.0 and download schema subsets from the
  [NIEM Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT) pre-release server](http://niemstaging.ittl.gtri.org/niemtools-4.0rc1/ssgt/index.iepd).
  The SSGT is currently hosting version 4.0rc1 (release candidate 1).
  

  
- The NIEM pre-releases are 
  [published on Github](https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM-Releases/tree/dev-niem-4.0).
  Release candidate 3 is
  [tagged as niem-4.0rc3](https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM-Releases/releases/tag/niem-4.0rc3),
  and may be
  [downloaded as a zip file](https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM-Releases/archive/niem-4.0rc3.zip).
