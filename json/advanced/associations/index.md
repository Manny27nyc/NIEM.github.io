title: Associations

Associations are relationships between objects.
Each association references the associated objects with the `@id` keyword from JSON-LD.

Here is an example of a NIEM association `j:OffenseLocationAssociation` in JSON schema:

```json
{%include_relative j.schema.json %}
```

Here is a JSON instance of that association:

```json
{%include_relative association.json %}
```
