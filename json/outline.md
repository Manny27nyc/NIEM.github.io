Defining a JSON Information Exchange Using NIEM Content

* Introduction
    * State the objective – this is an article series on how to define and specify an information exchange represented in JSON that uses content from NIEM
    *     Extensible
    * NIEM conformant
    * Audience
* Overview
    * Steps
        1.	Understand the JSON representation of NIEM
        2.	Determine business data content
        3.	Specify JSON representation of content
        4.	Document the JSON information exchange
* Understand the JSON representation of NIEM
    * The NIEM JSON representation conventions explained without using XML
    * JSON-LD – should?
    * Sample
        * A sample used as the bases for more detailed explanations
    * JSON-LD context
        * Explain how NIEM uses JSON-LD context
    * Etc
        * The rest of the conventions from Guidance section 3 in non-XML terms – need to discuss
* Determine business data content
    * Similar to the Analyze Requirements and Model parts of the IEPD Lifecycle (informative)
* Specify JSON representation of content
    * Similar to the Map part of the IEPD Lifecycle (informative)
    * Identify and extract NIEM content from the NIEM JSON Pile
        * What Webb is creating
    * Define extensions
        * Define JSON representations of content not in NIEM
* Document the JSON information exchange
    * Could be part of some larger-scope specification (e.g. OpenAPI)
* Human readable
    * Office documents, PDFs, graphics, markdown, etc. that define the JSON exchange
    * Samples
        * Samples of JSON instances
    * JSON Schema
        * Optional – additional subsections on how to do it
