title: Implementation Cookbook
---

<p>When you&rsquo;re creating an information exchange, you <em>rarely ever use NIEM by itself</em>. Depending on business requirements, there are other aspects of information exchange implementations that are required, including access controls, policy automation, transmission protocol, and others.</p>
<p>Based on our NIEM implementation experience, we've identified some common patterns (or "recipes," so to speak) to implement NIEM with other pieces of the information exchange puzzle.</p>
<p>The implementation cookbook serves as a single location for the community to learn and share reusable solutions for implementing NIEM.
<p>With your help, our goal is for the cookbook to define the many ways NIEM-based exchanges can be used within specific environments, with various technologies and standards. This includes programming languages, data formats, query languages, and messaging frameworks.</p>
<p>Remember, NIEM and other data standards are independent of any particular software. However, ensuring NIEM is expressed, defined, and used in various software platforms better enables reusability, portability, and interoperability&#8212;which is what this effort is working toward. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, each implementation recipe produces consumable, access controlled data. We encourage you to contribute to the open data conversation through groups like <a href="https://github.com/18f">18F</a>.</p>
